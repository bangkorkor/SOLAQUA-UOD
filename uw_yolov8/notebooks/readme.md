The notebooks in this dirctory are named after the dataset that we train the model on. ALL models follows the same uw_yolo architecture/build.
E.g. ruod.ipynb is trained on the ruod dataset, and in this notebook we find all the processing for the ruod dataset and making it train using the uw_yolo setup.

Note that I put the code for the dataset we are evaluating on in its notebook. e.g: RUOD trained, NTNU_fish tested will be put in NTNU_fishdata.ipynb.
