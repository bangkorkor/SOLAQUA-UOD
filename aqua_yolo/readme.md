# AquaYOLO

In this folder I have replicated the model-architecture proposed in the paper: [AquaYOLO: Enhancing YOLOv8 for Accurate Underwater Object Detection for Sonar Images](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-1312/13/1/73). 


**TODO**:
- M performes better than L for the fullmatch architecture? This is because of modifications i made on the model. I should try different kernel sizes (e.g in DSAM) and compare the results. 
- We should run the evaluaton code for the different models
- Update this readme. Add results section and look over everything. Should match structure of uw_yolo
-
